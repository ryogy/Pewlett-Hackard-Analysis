# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett Hackard is about to see a large portion of its senior workforce retire.  In order to counter this oncoming retirement wave, a mentorship program is going to be enacted to bring junior staff into more senior roles in the company.  The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of people that will be retiring by their job title, and what workers in senior roles would be eligible to mentor the junior workforce during their last years at the company.

## Results

*   Upon determining the number of employees up for retirement it becomes clear that Pewlett Hackard needs to act quickly to stay competitive as a large portion of their workforce is about to retire.  The Retiring Titles table, shown below, indicates that the majority of the retiring titles are either Senior Staff or Senior Engineers.  These are the titles that should be focused on for the possible mentorship program as these roles will create the largest deficit.

* The Technique Leader is also a role that would contribute to an employee workload deficit and this could be assigned secondary priority as the Senior Engineer and Staff positions take precendent as they represent the bulk of the retirement titles.

* Seeing that there are very few senior titles in management, this could be an oppurtunity to bring more of the titles that are eligible for the mentorship program into management roles.  Senior employees typically possess more domain knowledge surrounding the company and its products and are perfect candidates for management positions.

* See Mentorship Eligibility Table Below...

  In comparison to the number of retirees there are not many senior roles that eligible for the mentorship program.  This will need to be addressed by either making more employees eligible for mentorship or with additional hiring of senior positions.

## Summary
The major problem facing Hewlett Packard is that it will have a difficult time preparing or establishing a mentorship program.  Looking at the difference in total counts between the number of retiring employees within certain roles and then the mentorship eligibility of employees in that same role, it will be extremely difficult to mentor the number of junior employess that need to be promoted in order to make up for the deficit of senior roles that are retiring.  Looking at the unrequired deliverable presented above that counts the mentorship eligibility per role, it is clear that an different strategy must be used in order to account for the retiring positions.  A combination of promoting top staff and hiring new employees at all levels of the company will help to make up for the massive retirement wave while also keeping Pewlett Hackard competitive.
